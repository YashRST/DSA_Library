# Project Name

## Features

### Sorting Algorithms
Implements various sorting algorithms such as:
- Binary Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Cocktail Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Linear Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

### Data Structures
Includes the following data structures:
- Doubly Linked List
- Singly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue

### Utility Functions
General-purpose utility functions for assisting in sorting and data structure manipulation.

## How to Build
To build the static library and test cases, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root of the project directory.
2. Compile the library and source files using a C compiler. For example, you can use `gcc` to build the library:
    ```bash
    gcc -c src/*.c -Iinclude
    ar rcs lib/DSLib.lib *.o
    ```
3. To compile the test cases, you can use the following command:
    ```bash
    gcc testCase/binaryInsertionSortTest.c -o testCase/binaryInsertionSortTest -Iinclude -Llib -lDSLib
    ```
4. Repeat the process for each test case.

## How to Run Tests
After building the test cases, navigate to the `testCase` directory and run the executables to verify the functionality of the corresponding algorithm or data structure.

For example, to run the test for binary insertion sort, use:
```bash

./binaryInsertionSortTest.exe
```
you should see the output indicating the result of the tests.
